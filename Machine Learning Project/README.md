Problem Statement

Explore the e cacy of machine learning (ML) in characterizing exoplanets into di erent classes. The source of
the data used in this work is University of Puerto Rico's Planetary Habitability Laboratory's Exoplanets Catalog
(PHL-EC). Perform a detailed analysis of the structure of the data and propose methods that can be used to
e ectively categorize new exoplanet samples. Contributions are two-fold; elaborate on the results obtained
by using ML algorithms by stating the accuracy of each method used and propose a paradigm to automate the task
of exoplanet classification for relevant outcomes. 


Data Cleaning
  - Replace Missing Values
  - Remove Uncorrelated Data

Algorithms to be used
  - Neural Networks
  - Principal Component Analysis
  - K-NN
  - Random Forest

Classify the dataframe
  - 20:80
  - 10:20:70 (Validation:test:train)
  
Train the data until the accuracy becomes greater than 0.95. Collect and store HASH, create the validation dataframe. Check the accuracy and ensure there's no overfitting. 


Timeline

Data Cleaning - Monday 8th Oct, 2019 (Done)

Implementing the models - Oct 9, 2019 to Oct 20, 2019

Test/Train - First week of November

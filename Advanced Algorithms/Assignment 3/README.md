<h1> Advanced Algorithms Assignment 1</h1>
<h2>General Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This repo contains the header file and a test file. You will only have to write the implementation file(s)</li> 
    <li>include folder contains the header file(s)</li>
    <li>src folder contains the implementation file(s)</li>
    <li>test folder contains the test file(s)</li>
    <li>An interface is used in java, but a similar concept is there in C++ called pure virtual functions. An interface is used to specify what methods should be implemented. If a method isn't implemented, there is a compilation error if you try to make an object of that class. The concept of interfaces isn't really important right now, just think of it as a way to know what functions you have to write, and that since the implementation is a separate class, you can write that however you want. The only things that have to match are the function prototypes.</li> 
    <li>The testing framework is taken from here -> https://github.com/onqtam/doctest<br>
    The given tests are known as unit tests. Each test is meant to test only a single functionality at a time. Looking at the code should give you a better idea. You don't have to write any tests yourself, but something like this is done for production code. We have given a sanity check test, which tests really simple functionality, just to check if the bare minimum works, and that there are no compilation issues.<br> 
    You can compile the test and run it like it's any other C++ file, i.e. <br>g++ filename.cpp<br>./a.out
    </li>
    <li>All STL libraries are allowed for this assignment</li>  
    <li>With respect to the language, we are using g++ to compile. g++ is used for C++, but compiles C code too. There are some differences between gcc and g++, so we recommend that you use g++ too.<br>
    We are testing on ubuntu 18.04 with g++ version 7.4.0. Make sure it works on that, some of you maybe using OS/compiler specific features.</li>
    <li>Discussion between yourselves is fine, but not copying. We would be running a plagiarism detection script</li>
    <li>There might be small changes to the assignment, so pull the code from the repo to make sure you're up to date.</li>
    <li>Deadline - TBD</li>
    <li>Submission - Would be through a google form.</li>
    <li>What to submit - TBD. (Implementation files and a report)</li>
    <li>The report should be a maximum of 1 page (in IEEE format http://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/Transactions-instructions-only.pdf) for each problem given here.</br>
    The 1 page is only an upper limit. Brief answers that contain everything are preferred. Don't fill up pages for the sake of it.</li>
    <li>If you have any queries, put it up in the query form -> https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfm8FUjHU-LBQV8Y-zyN71br2pxadWCVgXQOzE13f6WEwJ5uA/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1. This is to reduce the number of mails we would get as keeping track of all of them is hard. It also reduces the number of similar questions asked.</br>

<h2>Suffix Array/Tree</h2>
    <p>You will have to implement a suffix array or a tree. The relevant functions are given in the header.</p>
    <h3>Constraints</h3>
    <p>Maximum number of characters in the file = 10^7.<br> 
    The maximum number of documents/input length for a particular document is 10^5.
    i.e. there can be 100 documents each containing 10^5 characters or
    there can be 10^5 documents each containing 100 characters.</br>
    The query for searching will be not be greater than 10^5 characters.</br>
    The input will be ascii characters.</br>
    The build time, i.e. the amount of time to construct the array/tree should not exceed 1 minute.</br>
    The search time for each individual query should not exceed 10 seconds.</br>
    The amount of memory for the duration of execution should not exceed 2GB.</br>

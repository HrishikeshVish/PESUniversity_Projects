<h1> Advanced Algorithms Assignment 4</h1>
<p> Assignment 4 is an easy one. 
<h2>General Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Deadline - TBD</li>
    <li>Submission - Would be through a google form.</li>
    <li>What to submit - Implementation files and a report</li>
    <li>The report should be a maximum of 1 page (in IEEE format http://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/Transactions-instructions-only.pdf)</br>
    The 1 page is only an upper limit. Brief answers that contain everything are preferred. Don't fill up pages for the sake of it.</li>
    <li>If you have any queries, put it up in the query form -> https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfm8FUjHU-LBQV8Y-zyN71br2pxadWCVgXQOzE13f6WEwJ5uA/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1. This is to reduce the number of mails we would get as keeping track of all of them is hard. It also reduces the number of similar questions asked.</br>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>You will have to implement the Miller Rabin algorithm (as defined here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test) for primality testing. Once you have implemented it, run experiments by varying input parameters and try to measure the level of security. 

Plot your results and add them to the report.

PS: In addition to C/C++, you can also use Python for this assignment. It would make graphing and large intergers easy to work with.</p>
